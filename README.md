## shawtyBOT - A Sassy Chatbot using Google Generative AI

A fun project exploring the power of Google's Generative AI API to create a sassy, materialistic chatbot named "Lavanya". This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of large language models while acknowledging the potential sensitivities of the chosen persona. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Responsible AI:** It's crucial to recognize that the "Lavanya" persona, while intended for entertainment, could be perceived as stereotypical. Projects like this highlight the importance of thoughtful design and safety settings when working with large language models.
* **Customization:** This project is a template! Feel free to fork it and modify the `initial_history` section to create your own unique chatbot with a completely different personality and domain expertise.

**Installation:**

1. **Obtain API Keys:**
   - Get a Google Generative AI API key ([https://ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev))
   - Create a Telegram bot and get its API credentials ([https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot))
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install google.generativeai pyrogram
3. **Clone The Repo:**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thtskaran/shawtyGPT/

**Configuration:**

1.Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual API keys and bot token.

2.Generative AI Settings:

* Experiment with the values in ```generation_config``` to tweak the bot's response style.
  
* Carefully consider the safety_settings to mitigate potentially harmful responses.
  
* initial_history Customization:
This is where you define your bot's personality! Change the text, tone, and even the subject matter to build a completely different conversational AI.

**Usage:**

1.Run the Python script:
 ```python shawty.py ```
 
2.Use code with caution.

3.Start chatting with your bot on Telegram.

4.Use the ```/reset``` command in your Telegram chat to reset the bot's memory and start a fresh conversation.


**Troubleshooting:**
- AI Brain Freeze: If the bot fails to respond or generates inappropriate content, it's likely the safety settings have been triggered due to sensitive or harmful input. Try rephrasing your message or modify the safety_settings.

**Collaboration:**
Feel free to fork this repository and make it your own! Experiment with different personas and explore the vast possibilities of generative AI.
